# SmartEnergy  

SmartEnergy is a database-driven system designed for efficient facility and meter management. The system implements different user roles with specific permissions:  

- **Technician**: Can submit meter readings for facilities assigned to them via a form.  
- **Supervisor**: Manages multiple facilities, assigns technicians, and reviews meter readings from their assigned facilities.  
- **Manager**: Can assign supervisors and technicians to facilities, and has all the functionalities of both technicians and supervisors.  

The system ensures smooth workflow and accountability across all levels of facility management.
